// It may import itself, by its own name, and that is the only way one of its folders reaches another:
// `../` is refused everywhere, and an `@src` alias cannot work here, because `shared` is compiled as raw
// source by whichever package imports it — `@src` would resolve into that package's tree, not this one.
// `@janggi/shared/janggi/settings/BotElo` means the same thing from every package that reads it.
